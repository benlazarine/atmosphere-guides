# Atmosphere Guides

This site hosts documentation for Atmosphere, the free, open-source cloud computing project (as distinct from CyVerse's "cloud computing for scientists" service). It is intended for both "site operators" (groups interested in operating/supporting their own Atmosphere deployment), users (very incomplete), and developers who are interested in contributing to the project.
